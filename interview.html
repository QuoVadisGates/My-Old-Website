                    <p> - Who or what inspires you? </p>
                    I'm inspired by rags to riches stories, even though finances are one of the ways we measure success the financial gain isn't what keeps my attention. For me these stories aren't necessarily about the monitary collasal they've been abile to assume, but the courage these people had to dream despite their starting points, the presistence displayed when encountering tempariory failure, and their audasity to believe in themselves. The monitary success just makes it believable that they succeed.

                   <p> - How would you direct traffic in the result of a catastrophic earthquake? </p>
                   First I would stop all traffic. Communicate to all person's effected the severity of the situation and direct them to get in communication with their loved ones; this will ease the anziety of the people, less worry will help bring order.  Next, round up a team; this team and I would go out to determine the safest routes of travel, once those pathways are determined we'd ask for the people's patience as we help them to their desired destinations.

                <p> <div id="main-interview7">
                    <p> - Name five characteristics you would want in a team. </p>
                    Creativity, trust, confidence, commitment, and great communication.

                    <p> - What plans do you have to advance your programming education? </p>
                    I'll continue teaching others to code, which comes with the benefit of better understanding and sharpening my skills in the process.  I also plan to continue my traditional methods of reading programming book and enrolling in online courses.

                <p> <div id="main-interview6">
                    <p> - What's the most creative way you can break a clock? </p>
                    A broken clock is still right two times a day, so taking the batteries out or removing anything besides the hands won't be an absolute answer.  So I would send 50% of all clocks on Earth into space and send them around the world at thousands of miles per hour.  Once the clocks are returned we'll see that because of the theory of relativity's time dilation the clocks on Earth and those sent which have not been physically changed will read different times because the faster you go the more time dialates. Leaving all clock physically perfect yet visually inaccrate.

                <p> <div id="main-interview1">
                    <p> - What drives you? </p>
                    I'm driven by the urge to help people.  I think that we're all on this planet to help one another. The purpose of me choosing to develop software is because no matter race, religion, or placement on the planet most humans are using computers. As I hone my abilities to be become a better developer and earning opportunities to comiborate with talented minds we'll produce solutions to make people's lives better, easier, and happier.

                    <p> - If you could throw a parade of any caliber, what type of parade would it be? </p>
                    A huge one for the teachers, soldiers, police officers, fire fighters, nurses, doctors, and regular shelter volunteers. This parade would be for the unsong heros who dedicate their lives to helping, and protecting others.

                    A really long novel to nurture my imagination, a really large notebook to write my thoughts and experiences.

                    <p> - You have five bottles with pills. One bottle has 9 gram pills; the others have 10 gram pills. You have a scale that can only be used once. How can you find out which bottle contains the 9 gram pills? </p>
                    Set the scale to grams place all bottles on the scale at once, it should equal 49 grams.  Remove bottles from the scale one-by-one, aiming to subtract 10 with each bottle removed.  The bottle that subtracts 9 from the total is the lucky one.
