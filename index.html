                        "I'm driven by the urge to help people.  I think we're all on this planet to help one another. A purpose of me choosing to develop software is that no matter race, religion, or placement on this planet most humans are using computers. As I hone my abilities to be become a better developer and earn opportunities to colliborate with talented minds we'll produce solutions to make people's lives better, easier, and happier."

                        <h1>Journey</h1>
                        Studying Economics as a minor and majoring in Philosophy at Morehouse College in Atlanta, Ga. I found myself more interested in the computing industry then those I studied.  Trying to ignore this interest because of the expensive degree I'd paid for, I went into management. Despite achieving in this area, I could no longer ignore that most of my free time was spent in the computing space. Found myself researching: how computers work, the programs that make using them people friendly, and most interesting was their ability to make life easier. So I decided to learn, which later advanced into teaching others.

                        <h1>Work</h1>
                        The pages to come are examples of my work, programming languages I have experience in, notes taken while learning (which can be used for your own personal projects) and tutorial videos where you can sharpen your skills.  Get to know me in the interview section, and take a look at what other's think of me in expert advise. Hope you enjoy.
